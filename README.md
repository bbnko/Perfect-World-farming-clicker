# Perfect-World-farming-clicker
Very simple farming clicker / script / bot for Perfect World game. Was used for 1.3.6. game version on non-official servers.

Script sends pet to attack mobs, runs in melee range, deals damage using basic skill, picks up loot and heals the pet.
Also comes back to a stated position & uses utility skills(heal, mana regen, mana-hp swap), feeds pet, swaps veapons.

Requirements: make sure to keybind (in-game):

Melle attack - 1 (on all bars)
Basic druid damage spell - 2 (on all bars)
Pet heal - F2
Loot pickup - F4
Different weapons (same copies of weapon bought from Weaponsmith work best, since you will always deal same damage) - 7 (different one on each skill bar)
Pet food - 9 (on one bar)
Utility skills (heal, mana regen, mana-hp swap) - 8 (different one per bar)

Adjust the part where script opens the 'saved positions list' & make sure to create a coordinate location in-game where the bot will return to desired position.

Alternatively, you may delete the mouse movement part and keep double click only, but make sure to keep mouse coursor in position where it clicks on the set coordinates (so that the game engages the auto-path option).
